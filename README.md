# Theme WPUGPH
Modern Theme using UIKit 3 with good support for Gutenberg block styling. Based on gutenbergtheme https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg-starter-theme.

Work in progress.

## Block focused
If something isn't a block yet, this theme will not have it. As each block happens, the theme will gain that functionality.

## Styling just like Gutenberg
The idea of the default look for this theme is to as closely replicate that of the Gutenberg editor output as possible. As a result the focus is on that styling not creating a new look.. yet. As things grow, we may have styles and go further into what the theme can have... who knows.

## GNU General Public License v2
This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL. Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.
